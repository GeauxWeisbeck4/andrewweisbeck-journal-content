summary: It seemed like I started planning this site out as soon as I finished the first version of GeauxWeiseck4.dev - I think I'll be changing it again soon as well for various reasons, but this was great practice..

# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev - My Professional Dev Website

I kind of had this site in my head by the time I started coding it - so there was no Figma or nothing. Which is absolutely insane and fucking stupid to do because it totally makes your life a pain in the ass when you decide to not plan out a website that you are building from scratch. I f I could go back in time, I would go back and take my lazy ass out back and break a keyboard over my head and then fire me from my own project and then tell myself to go fuck off. It really was that bad making this website - it took literally 5x as long to make because of my stupid laziness.

Things that went well with this website - oh, let's see... NOTHING! Well ok, I sort of implemented the design in my head, but I had no color palette or theme and its apparent when you first look at the website. Plus it just kind of looks like I threw things together one night after I got sick of fucking with the website.

I guess I had good enthusiasm? No, that's not true. I guess it's not the aboslute worst site I've made, plus it's super fast cause it runs off of EDeno and 11ty.

## I don't have much else to say

I really don't at this time. Maybe I'll come back and feel better about it someday, but it's more likely that I just fucking rip that thing apart and start over with JSX and not just Nunjucks. I'm sorry this one sucked.

But tell me if you like it! I dunno maybe it'll sway me.
