# Andrew Weisbeck's Developer Journal

My developer journal was an important project that I had put off for far too much time. I had kept my developer diary or dev journal private, which was probably a big mistake on my part. People couldn't actually see what I was working on or what I know. So here we are, a whole year later with my first version of my Developer Journal! I hope you find it informative, wholesome, and entertaining.

## Inspiration for this Project

Well I would have to first of all say that I kind have always had a dev journal - I just didn't share it with any of you. That's super selfish of me. I could have been sharing very valuable information and lessons learned with the world, but instead I chose to be greedy and horde all the cool web dev things I was learning to myself. Well, actually that's not entirely true. You can ask my fiance Lisa about how much I love to teach people about any thing - especially web development. I'm pretty sure she could code an entire app right now, just based off of what she has to listen to from me day, after day, after day, after day...

But I did struggle to get this website launched publicly for a few reasons:

### 1. I had a hard time writing about what I was doing because sometimes I felt like I didn't know what I was doing.

This is really stupid - I did mostly know what I was doing. I was just lazy and didn't want to have to put in a little extra time each to to record my experience with what I was doing in regards to my work. That little documentation could have gone a far way in helping me get a job. Damn.

### 2. I struggle to know what I want my sites to look like sometimes because I want them to look so unique and perfect.

This is the one that drives me the most insane - my drive for perfection. No, that is not a good thing. Yes it is great to have high standards for yourself, but no perfection is not a good trait. I'm having to learn to get over my thoughts on what everyone else thinks about me becaues this drive for perfection, is absolutely critically defeating to my productivity levels.

FUCK YOU PERFECTION TRAITS! STAY AWAY FROM ME AND NEVER COME BACK AGAIN! I FIGURED OUT HOW TO STOP YOU!

Umm, ok. And reason number three...

### 3. 2022 was a really, really bad and off year for me.

Let's see - I didn't find a job the entire year despite applying for over 1,000 jobs; got evicted from my home - twice. A lot of bad personal stuff I can't shared on here happened. My taxes got audited after I made less than 30k last year and I owe the state of NC $1,000.

This year was so beyond incredibly difficult - it wasn't going to ever work for me to do this because I was just too miserable to do something good for

## The Future of This Project

Well you will constantly see the content updated on a pretty regular basis - like everyday when I get done with my journal entry. I also plan on doing blog posts as much as I can to build a good little database of info on my Supabase instance. I hope to continually update it with the repository and make the desing look a little more like me. You can follow it on GitHub at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4/) and contribute, participate or whatever. You can also get your own version of this blog with the template used here- [I snagged it from here](https://GitHub.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/).
