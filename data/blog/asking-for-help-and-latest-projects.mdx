# It's been tough times

Ever since I lost my job back in 2021, two days before Thanksgiving, life has been anything but kind and giving to me and my partner. Our family has faced setback after setback and it often seems like we will never catch any type of break, which seems ridiculous to think but its not too farfetched after the year we just experienced. We are currently facing straight up homelessness where we would basically be forced to the streets once we run out of money to pay for our hotel bill.

I have created a [fundraiser that you can contribute to if you would like to help out](https://fundly.com/help-us-avoid-homelessness-2) - you have no idea how grateful we are for any help at all, even if that just means sharing it with your network of people. You can also read the entire story here on [my most recent Medium post](https://geauxweisbeck4.medium.com/this-is-hard-to-do-but-asking-for-help-a033af27f2e3).

Thank you for your consideration.

## What'd I work on today?

So this is clearly being edited after 12 am when I am working on the same things, but most of this work can be attributed to January 5th, 2023:

- Spent most of the day searching and applying for jobs, like usual. Also searched for housing - please see words above.
- Worked on fundraiser page.
- Worked on this website and also created a new project, the NextJS Chat GPT Website. Check it out its fun!

## What'd I learn today?

Well this isn't really anything new, but nonetheless this is [a very interesting story about our government being shady](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/). Spoiler alert - the Bush and Obama Administrations really wanted to cover up their NSA Spying activities.... oh you already knew? Hmmm....

Also, nobody cares that you're about to be on the streets except a very select few people who really, really, really care about you. I just hope I can find a way to keep programming while we're out there.
