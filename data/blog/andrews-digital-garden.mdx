# Andrew's Digital Garden

I used to have a digital garden, but I took it down because I didn't think that I was keeping up with everyone else, which is stupid! I should have been sharing my knowledge with the world from day one. Shame on me.

Anyways, I love this project - it was fun, it still is, and always will be. It's kind of a project that will always keep on giving. The knowledge base will grow forever, or until I cease to continue using my brain to learn things. I also have SO MANY NOTES to share - like good god. You would think I was a little scribe with all the pages of notes I have on Roam, Logseq, Dendron, and Obsidian.

## How'd I do it?

I was going to converge everything into one big template on Dendron until I found [this awesome digital garden template for obsidian](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/01-getting-started/). I still want to create my own theme, but for as far as my original Digital Garden with Obsidian, this is about as good as it gets. There's the graph, the layout is cool, and the theme is customizable to your Obisdian setup - only if you want to. But I stil will create a theme that I may or may not use in the future for practice and street cred - I really want to sell templates online sell
