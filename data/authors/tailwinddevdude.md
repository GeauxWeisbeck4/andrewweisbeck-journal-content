# Yooooo, whatsuupppp dawg?!?!

HAHA! I'm Tailwind Devdude, one of the raddest coders out there on the streets. I'm stoked my homie Andrew invited me to
contribute here from time to time and I won't let y'all down. I love using Tailwind CSS with Alpine.js and i may even
have a little course coming this year on the subject matter.

I am currently studying Computer Science at Tailwind and Alpine .js University and I don't think I'll ever graduate.
HAHA!

No, seriously - I don't ever want to graduate so I am taking as much time as I can. Let's face it dude, nobody ever
wants to leave college. Especially me - they'll have to take me kicking and screaming!

When I'm not ripping lines of code or b-loads behind the keyboard, you can fine me skiing Alpine.js Mountain with my
homies or hanging with the ladies if you know what I mean!

Later dudes and dudettes!
