Hey y'all! My name is Andrew and I'm currently a freelance full-stack developer, working for myself under my brand **[Tar Heel Dev Studio](https://tarheeldevstudio.com)**.

I am available for work in more of a full-time role with the right organization as I am seeking the experience of working on a team. You can also hire me for your next project if you want a hard working, authentic, and honest web developer who will help you create something awesome with no bullshit involved.

My greatest strength would have to be my resilience. I have failed numerous times through out life and I never let those low moments dictate how I move forward in life. A close second would definitely be my love for reading and desire to learn (I consider them the same category), which is probably my greatest asset as anything is possible as long as you are willing to learn. Resilience keeps me going; curiosity and my love for learning helps me a achieve things.

My biggest weakness is that I sometimes let my ADHD run the show and it can be bad news when I don't mitigate the negative aspects of my mental health. The good news is that I take medication and adhere to a fairly rigourous organizational routine that helps me live my life like I'm a normal ol' normie.

I hope you enjoy my Dev Journal and learn something new about me, about full stack development, and about life in general. I'm a teacher at heart and love sharing information that I have with others - let me share what I know with you and let you create something awesome too!
