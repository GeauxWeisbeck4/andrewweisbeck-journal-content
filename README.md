# Andrew Weisbeck's Developer Journal

I have finally figured out how I am going to implement my Full Stack Developer Journal - using my favorite template ever - the classic Next.js-TailwindCSS Blog Template. I was going to use it for Tailwind DevDude a while back, but I got bigger ideas for Dev Dude. My personal dev journal is a pretty important project. It will be where people go to learn about what I know.

## Goals

- Make a blog/journal that has respectable and informed content.
- Utilize a beautiful layout
- Create it quickly for the new year
- Show off my professionalism as well as my personality

Next.js Tailwind CSS Blog template hits the mark with all of these. Yay!
