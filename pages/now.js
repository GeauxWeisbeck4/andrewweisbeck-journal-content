            I own a digital agency, focused on web development, graphic design, and SEO content
            marketing.

            Tar Heel Dev Studio represents more than just building something digital - I want to
            build a happier world for your business and everyone it affects. I'll choose values over
            money any day, small businesses over corporations, and non-profits over max-profit
            organizations.

            I've been looking for more jobs lately as it has slowed up at the end of the year. I am
            open to new jobs as well but am always focused on trying to get the next job for my
            digital studio as I haven't had a regular full-time web developer job yet. It was a
            rough year in 2022, but I think 2023 will be my break through year.

            I am working on a lot of content based projects like this Web Developer journal, my
            digital garden, and other projects where I manipulate strings nad other sets of data to
            get it to do what I want to on the front end. I love learning so much so I'm always
            having fun no matt

            I like to learn by doing, so I am constantly working on projects and trying new things

            I appreciate this template because it makes it so easy to get a blog up and running with

            My best friend is my fiance Lisa, and we are working on building a sex-toy ecommerce
            business together. I don't know where I would be in my life without her amazing
            personality, tender love, and soft caring personality. We have both been through a lot
            together and I wouldn't have it any other way.

            Life is really, really fucking hard - but it is so beautiful and immensely rich. And
            might I add rare? Look around yourelf - no, I mean look around yourself into the night
            sky. Look at space. Think of where the next planet of living, sentient beings could
            possibly be. Nowhere your eyes can see. All your eyes can see is a vast stretch of a
            dark vacuum of cold, darkness that never ends. We are lucky to be able to be alive to
            witness what we witness each and every day. Life is hard, but it is beautiful and rare.
